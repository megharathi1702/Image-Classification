# Image-Classification
Title: ðŸ§  Image Classification using Deep Learning (CNNs)
Description:
This project demonstrates a deep learning approach to classify images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The model is trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset, which contains 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes. The goal is to build a robust image classifier that can accurately predict unseen images.

Key Features:

Implemented using TensorFlow and Keras.

Data preprocessing and normalization applied for better convergence.

CNN architecture includes convolutional, max-pooling, and dense layers.

Model evaluation using accuracy and confusion matrix.

Visualizations for training progress and model performance.

Technologies Used:
Python, TensorFlow, Keras, Matplotlib, NumPy, scikit-learn

Outcome:
Achieved ~70â€“80% accuracy on test data depending on the training configuration. Ideal for foundational understanding of image-based deep learning applications.
