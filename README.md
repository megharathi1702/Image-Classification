# Image-Classification
This project demonstrates a deep learning approach to classify images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The model is trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset, which contains 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes. The goal is to build a robust image classifier that can accurately predict unseen images.
